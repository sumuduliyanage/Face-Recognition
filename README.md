# Face-Recognition
The core idea in this project is to identify people uniquely. Opencv libraries are used here. 

## INTRODUCTION
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.
